Secure export upload
--------------------

These schemas define how the responses of the upload site should appear for the
exporter to interact with correctly and securely. The OpenAPI specification for
the `export exchange upload API <https://gros.liacs.nl/swagger/?urls.primaryName=Export%20exchange%20API%20(view%20only)>`_
makes use of these schemas.
